# Single Price Grid

A responsive, static pricing grid component, built with pure HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Single Price Grid" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The main objective was to create a clean and modern pricing component with a responsive layout. This project is a great exercise in mastering **HTML and CSS** for creating a two-dimensional grid layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, without the need for JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For creating the semantic structure of the pricing grid and its different sections, including the main header, subscription details, and the "Why Us" section.
* **CSS3:** This is the sole technology for all the styling. It was used to create the responsive layout, handle typography, colors, and shadows, ensuring the component looks professional on all devices.
* **JavaScript:** This is a purely static project. No JavaScript was required for any functionality.

## Usage
